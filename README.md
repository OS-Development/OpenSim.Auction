OpenSim.Auction
===============

This repository will hold the last known version of the OpenSim.Auction module
created by Fly-Man- in 2010/2011

At this moment, I have no clue if it's still compiling correctly with the current
master of Opensim. But many people have asked if I would be able to put all 
the modules I made in the past on Github.
